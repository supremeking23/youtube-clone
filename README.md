# YouTube Clone

## Project Overview
YouTube Clone is a web application that mimics the core functionalities of YouTube, allowing users to search and browse videos. The application features a clean and responsive design, resembling the layout and navigation of the actual YouTube platform.

## Installation
To get started with YouTube Clone, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-clone.git
   cd youtube-clone
   ```

2. **Open the project in your favorite web browser**:
   Simply open `index.html` from the project directory to view the application.

## Usage
1. **Search for Videos**:
   Use the search bar at the center of the header to type in queries and search for videos.

2. **Navigate the Sidebar**:
   Use the sidebar to navigate through different sections like Home, Shorts, Subscriptions, etc.

3. **Interact with Video Cards**:
   The application will dynamically load video cards that you can click on to simulate viewing videos (this functionality can be elaborated further based on additional JavaScript implementation).

## Features
- Responsive design that works on various devices.
- Search functionality with a user-friendly interface.
- Navigation sidebar mimicking the original YouTube design.
- Initial setup includes a placeholder for video content.

## Dependencies
The project currently does not include a package.json file with dependencies. If you wish to extend the functionality (for example, by adding a backend), you can easily integrate popular libraries or frameworks such as:
- Express.js for server-side functionality.
- Axios or Fetch API for making HTTP requests.
